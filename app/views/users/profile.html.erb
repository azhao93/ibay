  <div class="col-md-12">The F-Squared Premium AlphaSector® Index seeks to help meet the real needs of individual investors
by participating in rising markets while placing an emphasis on preserving capital during severe and 
extended market declines. The Fund has an investment objective of long-term capital appreciation 
and strives to outperform the S&P 500® Index over market cycles while also seeking to deliver lower 
volatility, low beta, and low correlation. The F-Squared Premium AlphaSector® Index employs a flexible, 
proprietary quantitative model which can invest in any combination of the nine primary sectors of the S&P 
500®, a combination of sectors and cash equivalents, or 100% cash equivalents. Utilizes a proprietary 
quantitative model that seeks to evaluate “true” price trends within each sector, while eliminating market 
noise.1The model features an innovative, dynamic volatility factor that heightens the sensitivity of the 
model signals in periods of rising or high volatility.</div>
